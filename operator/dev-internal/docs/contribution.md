## Build and install locally

See the below steps to build and deploy the operator on your local kind cluster.

(Optional) Recreate your kind cluster **conveniently** from within this current repo.
You're welcome!
```
make nuke-kind
```
Run integration test
```
make integration-test 
```

Generate the Custom Resource **Definition** (`manifests`),
and apply it to the current cluster (`install`)
(see below to create an **instance** of the Custom Resource):
```
make manifests install
```

Build the controller manager binary from the go code:
```
make build
```

Run the controller manager on the local cluster:
```
# Create new local kind cluster
make nuke-kind
# Build and Deploy local operator image
make deploy
# Deploy Proxy
kubectl apply -f deploy/scenarios/wavefront-getting-started.yaml
```
