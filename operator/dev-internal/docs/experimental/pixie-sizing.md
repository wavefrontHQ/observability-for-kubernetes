- For general guidance installing pixing, see this README (TODO link)

## Configure Default Size

1. In order begin sizing your cluster's Pixie deployment, you must begin by choosing one of several presets. These are:
   1. Small (recommended for TODO clusters)
   1. Medium (recommended for TODO clusters)
   1. Large (recommended for TODO cluster)
   
2. Once you have chosen your preset size, specify it in the yaml like this (TODO yaml example)

   **Note**: If you are happy with your sizing, this is all that is required. The rest of this guide will cover how to further customize the resources, and how to check to see if the chosen size is appropriate.
