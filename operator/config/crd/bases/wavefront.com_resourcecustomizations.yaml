                                  Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard
                                  for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints
                                  of a particular category.

                                  of time the toleration (which must be of effect
                                  NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates
                                  the taint. By default, it is not set, which means
                                  tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero
                                  and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
                                  immediately) by the system.

                                  matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value
                                  should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
