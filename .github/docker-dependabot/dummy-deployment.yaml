        # Stay one minor version *behind* latest for stability purposes. For example, if dependabot
        # bumps to `proxy:11.6` in this file, then all our yaml should currently be at 11.4 and we
        # want to bump them to 11.5.
        # 1. Manually search/replace for references of `/proxy:11.4` and substitute 11.5.
        # 2. Manually update the version in operator/config/manager/component_versions.yaml
        # 3. Copy the proxy image to Harbor, see "Copying the proxy image to Harbor" in our Technical References confluence page for details
