# Helm Charts for Aria Operator

**NOTE:** These charts are not for use outside of Aria Hub. They will not work for standalone Wavefront/OpApps customers.

## Aria Operator Chart
Generated by release scripts.

## Installing

**Helm 3.8+**

Helm 3.8 adopted a different distribution model for Charts. OCI image registries are the preferred method of
distributing Charts going forward.

```
helm install aria-operator oci://projects.registry.vmware.com/tanzu_observability/helm-charts/aria-operator

helm install aria-hub oci://projects.registry.vmware.com/tanzu_observability/helm-charts/aria-hub \
  --set clusterName=<CLUSTER_NAME> \
  --set k8sEvents.url=<URL> \
  --set k8sEvents.token=<LEMANS_TOKEN>
```

## Uninstalling
Run the following commands in this order.

```
helm uninstall aria-hub

helm uninstall aria-operator
```
If you ran the commands in the wrong order, you may see this error `Error: failed to delete release: aria-hub`. 

If you do, you will need to additionally run the following command before you can reinstall aria-hub:

```
kubectl delete secret sh.helm.release.v1.aria-hub.v1
```
